# AltCodes

AltCodes is a website that I  have created to help teach people how to type special characters with accentations used in Spanish and other languages without having to switch between and learn different keyboard layouts. I first started to develop AltCodes as a tool to help myself type characters used in Spanish on 3/29/2024 and finished it on 3/31/2024 and I would slightly improve on it every once and a while until 8/3/2024 when I decided that I should fix some of its biggest issue and then share it to the world by hosting it on GitHub, hence why you are reading this text right now!

## Important Notes

* AltCodes is meant for computer and is not very compatible on other devices.
* You can only type numbers with the num pad.
* You can type either the character shown on screen or the code associated with it.
* You can't Select, Copy, Paste, or Cut any thing in the website.
* You can press . on the num pad to clear your answer.
* You aren't supposed to stress yourself out if you can't get the hang of it, the whole point is to learn and if it's difficult for you that's okay because everybody has their own way of learning things the best they can :)

## Current Characters.

Here are the current characters that are taught in AltCodes. They are only characters from Spanish but I do plan to add other characters from many other languages in the future!
